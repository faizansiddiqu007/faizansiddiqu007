# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Faizan

I began my journey in applied technology with a curiosity for language, cognition, and data-driven systems. Early in my undergrad at Jamia Millia Islamia, I dove deep into computational linguistics and mixed-lingual NLPâ€”publishing research on language disambiguation and exploring the nuances of homographs and contextual language understanding.

That foundation led me toward building intelligent systems with real-world utility. At CommVersion and Jaffery Enterprises, I developed AI tools that automated chat compliance, enabled sentiment-driven lead generation, and optimized software efficiency through full-stack development. I didnâ€™t just write codeâ€”I learned how to build scalable tools that aligned with business impact.

Winning a Generative AI Hackathon during my Master's at Dalhousie confirmed that I thrive at the bleeding edge. Whether itâ€™s a LangGraph-powered agent, a RAG system fine-tuned for pharma scientists, or a multimodal captioning model that aids diagnosisâ€”my work blends engineering precision with applied machine learning intuition.

Iâ€™ve worn many hats: data engineer, NLP researcher, dashboard developer, and AI architect. From transforming disjointed Excel systems into live Power BI dashboards to developing fine-tuned GPT agents using Proximal Policy Optimization, my goal remains the same: build AI thatâ€™s useful, explainable, and human-aligned.

These experiences naturally drew me into leadership, research, and startup ecosystems. At Paraza Pharma, I built pipelines that support drug research. In academic circles, I presented at SEMLA on contextual AI for content moderation. Iâ€™ve contributed to Springer-published research and been involved in multi-team collaboration across domains like healthcare, security, and automation.

Now, I focus on bridging the AI-product gapâ€”whether by building RAG-based assistants, streamlining infrastructure, or advising early-stage teams on how to turn research into systems that scale.

Mentorship and knowledge-sharing are close to my heart. I regularly write about AI trends and system design, and Iâ€™ve supported students and junior engineers in navigating this fast-changing space. I believe the next generation of AI leaders needs both technical depth and systems thinkingâ€”and I aim to contribute to that movement.

With roots in NLP and research, and hands-on experience across cloud, dashboards, LLMs, and ML workflows, Iâ€™m always excited to collaborate on projects that challenge convention and amplify human potential.

Letâ€™s build something that matters.
